# Building an end-to-end prototype

In this sub-directory a semantic segmentation model prototype is developed end-to-end.

Topics covered:
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Tables, Artifacts and Reports in W&B (see [notebook](01_ExplorDataAnalysis) and [report](https://wandb.ai/doc93/mlops-course-001/reports/Exploration-of-BDD1K-Autonomous-Vehicle-dataset--Vmlldzo1MDUzNjU1)).
* Datasets partitioning and versioning with Artifacts in W&B (see [notebook](02_PrepareDataForTrain.ipynb) and [report](https://wandb.ai/doc93/mlops-course-001/reports/Split-of-BDD1K-Autonomous-Vehicle-dataset--Vmlldzo1MDU1Nzg5)).
* Tracking and analyzing W&B model training experiments (see [notebook](03_TrainBaselineModel.ipynb) and [report](https://wandb.ai/doc93/mlops-course-001/reports/Baseline-report--Vmlldzo1MDU3NTMy)).

W&B tools used: 
* Tables
* Artifacts
* Experiments
* Reports
